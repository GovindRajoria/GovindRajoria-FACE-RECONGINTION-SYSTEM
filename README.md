# 🧠 Face Recognition System

A Python-based AI system for **real-time face capture**, **model training**, and **face recognition** using OpenCV. Designed to be lightweight, scalable, and easy to use — no GPU required!

---

## 🔑 Key Features

✅ **Three-Step Workflow**  
- **📸 Face Capture** (`face_taker.py`) — Collects 120 training images per user.  
- **🧠 Model Training** (`face_trainer.py`) — Trains using OpenCV’s LBPH algorithm.  
- **🎯 Real-Time Recognition** (`face_recognizer.py`) — Identifies faces and shows confidence scores.

✅ **User-Friendly CLI** — Guided prompts for seamless interaction.  
✅ **Scalable** — Add unlimited users by re-running the capture script.  
✅ **Lightweight** — Works on CPU using Haar Cascades + LBPH (no GPU needed).
